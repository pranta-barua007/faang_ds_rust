// STEP 1: Find Recurrence Relationship
// STEP 2: Find Base Cases, and Recursive Case

// Recurrence Relationship
// knightProb(k, r, c) = (1/8) * sum(knightProb(k-1, r', c')) for all valid (r', c')
// where r' = r + x and c' = c + y for each (x, y) in KNIGHT_DIRECTIONS

// Base Cases
// c < 0 || c >= n || r < 0 || r >= n -> return 0
// knightProb(0, r, c) = 1 if (r, c) is on the board else 0 (when off the board)

// Recursive Case
// knightProb(k, r, c) = (1/8) * sum(knightProb(k-1, r', c')) for all valid (r', c')

// Bottom up Approach
// identify the recusrive depth driving factor, which is k here
// here we will start from 0 will go to k
// at k = 0 we know the prob of knight is 1 at (row, column) and 0 at all other places
// then we will use our dp at k=0 to find the prob at k=1 then so on till k

// Time and Space Complexity

// Time Complexity: O(8 * 2.n^2 * k) -> drop the constant 8 and 2 -> O(n^2 * k)
// here n^2 * k is the number of possible states, because we have n*n positions
// and k moves, so total n*n*k states and for every state we are doing

// Space Complexity: O(n^2 * k)
// where n^2 * k is the size of the dp array we are using to store the results of subproblems
